/**
 * gstack context-bill — token bill-of-materials for an installed gstack skills tree.
 *
 * Read-only, offline, deterministic. Ledgers over pure file reads:
 *   ALWAYS-ON  per-skill YAML frontmatter bytes (what every session's skill
 *              scanner loads), flagging frontmatter keys the router never
 *              reads and foreign-host files in scanner scope.
 *   EAGER      SKILL.md plus any references the skill's prose forces "for
 *              every invocation".
 *
 * This is a STRIPPED port of the v2 fork's six-ledger bill: the CONDITIONAL,
 * TRANSITIVE, LAZY, and FAST-PATH parsers only understand the fork's
 * dispatcher-skill layout, which this repo's skills don't use, so they were
 * dropped rather than shipped dead. The tier fields stay in the report shape
 * (empty arrays / zeros / nulls) so re-adding a parser is additive: nothing
 * downstream needs a schema change.
 *
 * Token figures come from one of two sources, always named in the output:
 *   ESTIMATE (default, offline)  bytes / TOKEN_DIVISOR, calibrated against real
 *                               count_tokens measurements.
 *   EXACT (--exact, opt-in)      Anthropic's count_tokens for every billed .md
 *                               file inside the tree, the linked gstack
 *                               checkout or $GSTACK_STATE_ROOT/render; anything
 *                               else a symlink reaches is named and estimated,
 *                               and the bill is labelled mixed. Sends file
 *                               content off-machine, so it is never implicit:
 *                               an egress receipt is written before the POSTs
 *                               (sink 'context-bill-exact'), and if the
 *                               receipt cannot be written the run degrades to
 *                               the offline estimate with a warning instead of
 *                               sending unrecorded.
 * Both bytes and tokens are always shown, and the estimate's measured error
 * band is printed with it. The tool never writes state anywhere (the egress
 * receipt under --exact is the one exception, and it is the point).

 * Bytes per token, per content class, fitted to real count_tokens measurements.
 *
 * Calibration corpus: 219 `.md` skill files plus their frontmatter blocks,
 * measured 2026-08-01 against `claude-opus-4-5` with the per-request message
 * envelope subtracted. Regenerate with `gstack-context-bill <tree> --exact
 * --json` and read the `calibration` block, which grades this estimate
 * against measured counts file by file.
 *
 * Why classes and not one divisor: measured bytes-per-token spans 2.36 to 4.72
 * across the corpus, and the spread is largely structural. Legacy specialist
 * modules cluster at 3.47 (n=50, range 3.10-3.83) and SKILL.md bodies at 4.21
 * (n=50, range 3.65-4.50) -- tight enough that one divisor for both charges
 * some ledgers about 19% under while charging others about right. Splitting on
 * path roles cuts mean per-file error from 11.1% to 7.4% and removes the
 * systematic bias, which is what a cost tool owes.
 *
 * What classes do NOT fix: the `reference` class is genuinely heterogeneous
 * (2.36 to 4.72 -- dense path/table files sit at one end, prose at the other),
 * so worst-case per-file error stays near 40%. Use --exact when a single
 * file's number has to be right.
 *
 * These divisors are tokenizer-specific. Opus 4.7 and later tokenize
 * differently; on those models use --exact.

 * content. A child repo checkout (the

 *
 * Symlinked files and directories are followed, and every returned path stays

 * Each real directory is expanded once and each real file returned once per
 * walk, under the first lexical path reached with entries in sorted order: a

 * into each other cannot multiply the walk. A directory that encloses `dir`,
 * or `billedRoot` (the tree a skill is billed under), is never entered. A link
 * named *.md counts only when its target is a .md file too, so --exact never
 * sends a non-markdown file through a markdown-named link. More than
 * WALK_ENTRY_CAP entries is an error, never a silent cut.
 *
 * With `skipNestedSkills`, a top-level subdirectory holding its own SKILL.md is
 * not entered, so a container skill keeps the files it shares with a nested
 * skill instead of losing them to whichever path sorted first. The root
 * container also skips a nested skill reached through a directory link at any
 * depth: discovery bills that skill on its own, and the plain walk this
 * replaced never followed directory links, so counting it here too would bill
 * it twice.

 * one link however deep the lexical path runs: a chain of links never hits
 * the kernel's link-depth limit (ELOOP) and silently loses the files past it.
