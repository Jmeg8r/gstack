/**
 * pregate/environment — tells a failure the machine caused from one the diff
 * caused (Lane D, GSTA-112; truther #617). A check that could not run its
 * command (a runner or guard binary missing from PATH, a network error or a
 * quota refusal before any test ran, a full disk) is `incomplete` under
 * PREGATE_ENVIRONMENT with `cause: 'environment'`, a kind and the line that
 * proves it, so a lane waives by cause and a reader never mistakes it for the
 * branch's fault. The classifier reads a command's output and exit code only;
 * the caller decides when to ask it: a local lane whose runner printed a test
 * summary is the diff's failure whatever its log says, and only a run with no
 * summary (nothing ran) is classified from its output, and only before any
 * test file started. A missing binary is the machine's only when the command's
 * own binary is off PATH: a script the diff controls that exits 127 or prints
 * "command not found" is the diff's failure (`classifyCommandEnvironment`).
