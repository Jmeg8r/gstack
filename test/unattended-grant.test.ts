/**
 * docs/unattended.md#what-an-unattended-session-may-do: the grant a parent

 * lane reads it where it reports done.
 *
 * Value: protects=the handoff pointer resolves to the grant section, and the grant states merge-never, the pinned-lease push form and the /modernize disposition; fails_when=the heading is renamed or moved, the pointer is dropped from the template or its render, or the grant loses a rule; why_new=no test reads the new section or the handoff pointer; seam=none; no_claim=that a run obeys the grant (eval-side)
